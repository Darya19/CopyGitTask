Private show 
I want your attention in this room,
Your eyes on mine.
Sit you down, hop onto your pot of gold,
You make me come alive.

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right,
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights,
Dripping in smiles, they come on down,
Take your seat now.

Put on a private show,
Pull the curtains until they close.
I put on a private show,
We'll be whiling all on the low.
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it,
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it.
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it,
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it.
Put on a private show,
Pull the curtains until they close.
I put on a private show,
We'll be whiling all on the low.

We don't need crowds, we just need us.
Put my feelings up, about to be rough?
All my tricks, they're spectacular, baby,
My encore is immaculate, baby.

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right,
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights.
Dripping in smiles, they come on down,
Take your seat now.

Put on a private show,
Pull the curtains until they close.
I put on a private show,
We'll be whiling all on the low.
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it,
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it.
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it,
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it.
